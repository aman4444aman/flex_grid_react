      <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
      <p>With a Bachelor of Computer Application (BCA) degree, I have a solid foundation in computer science and software development. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I volunteered in data gathering and management to assist the government in tracking and recording data about COVID-19 patients. This experience honed my skills in data management and reinforced my problem-solving abilities. I am now keen on expanding my knowledge in IT's growing trends, exploring new technologies, and continuously learning to stay updated in this ever-evolving field.</p>
